# Enigma

## Background and Description

Enigma was a 1 week solo sprint project to to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

#Key Learnings:
OOP, understanding of encryption algorithms, code organization using modules.

### Implementation Instructions
To set up locally:
 * Clone down the repository.
 
 To encrypt:
 * Open the message.txt file and write your message to encrypt
 * Run this command in your terminal. 
 ```ruby
 ruby ./lib/encrypt.rb message.txt encrypted.txt
```
 * You will receive this message with the key and date used to encrypt your message. The encrypted message will be shown 
 printed in the encrypted.txt file.
    * "Created encrypted.txt with the key 50816 and date 190320"
